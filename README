--Data Files--------------------------------------------------------------------

.font files - Font files are text files containing all the information the Font
class needs to write text to the screen. This is the format of a .font file:

    1. The maximum width of the font in pixels (a number), followed by a
       newline.
    2. The height of the font, followed by a newline.
    3. The number of pixels in between each character horizontally, followed by
       a newline.
    4. Another newline. (So there is a blank line.)
    5. 128 numbers separated by newlines. The first number is the width of the
       character with ASCII code 0, the next number is the width of the
       character with ASCII code 1, etc.
    6. Another newline. (So there is a blank line.)
    7. From here on is the font data. A '0' char represents a blank pixel, and a
       '1' char represents a filled pixel. The font loader will ignore all chars
       other than '1' and '0' so you can format this however you want with all
       the whitespace you want. I format it like this:

           01000
           10100
           11100
           10100
           10100

       That would be a very small capital 'A'. Make sure you pad it with zeroes
       on the right if the character is smaller than the maximum width of the
       font.

--C++ Files---------------------------------------------------------------------

color.h - Typedefs the Color type as a u16. Defines macros for packing
red-green-blue values into a u16 (the same way the DS screens represent colors)
and unpacking them.

canvas.h, canvas.cpp - A Canvas is a 2-dimensional array of Colors. Canvases
can be created, copied onto other Canvases, and have pixels plotted on them. Two
Canvases are declared in canvas.h (screen_top and screen_bottom) which represent
the two DS screens and constantly get displayed to the DS screens.

font.h, font.cpp - Loads a font from the file system and provides methods for
displaying strings onto Canvases.

str.h, str.cpp - Contains string operation functions such as converting strings
to integers and integers to strings.
