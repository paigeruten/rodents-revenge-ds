--Files-------------------------------------------------------------------------

color.h - Typedefs the Color type as a u16. Defines macros for packing
red-green-blue values into a u16 (the same way the DS screens represent colors)
and unpacking them.

canvas.h, canvas.cpp - A Canvas is a 2-dimensional array of Colors. Canvases
can be created, copied onto other Canvases, and have pixels plotted on them. Two
Canvases are declared in canvas.h (screen_top and screen_bottom) which represent
the two DS screens and constantly get displayed to the DS screens.

font.h, font.cpp - Loads a font from the file system and provides methods for
displaying strings onto Canvases.

str.h, str.cpp - Contains string operation functions such as converting strings
to integers and integers to strings.
