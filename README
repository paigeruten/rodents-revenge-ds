			      Rodent's Revenge DS
				By Jeremy Ruten
				  Version 1.00

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rodent's Revenge DS is a Nintendo DS homebrew clone of Rodent's Revenge, a game
that used to come with Windows in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack.

Installation
------------

1. Copy the 'rodents-revenge' folder to the 'data' folder of your memory card.
   If you don't have a 'data' folder, create one.
2. DLDI-patch 'rodents-revenge.nds' unless your homebrew device does it for you
   (which is quite likely nowadays).
3. Copy 'rodents-revenge.nds' anywhere on your memory card, and run it.
4. If the screens turn green, there was a problem with DLDI. Make sure you
   patched it correctly. Otherwise, the game should work.

How to Play
-----------

The instructions are built in to the game and can be read by clicking the
'Help' button on the main menu.
