color.h - Typedefs the Color type as a u16. Defines macros for packing
red-green-blue values into a u16 (the same way the DS screens represent colors)
and unpacking them.

screen.h, screen.cpp - A Screen is a 2-dimensional array of Colors. Screens
can be created, copied onto other screens, and have pixels plotted on them. Two
Screens are declared in screen.h (screen_top and screen_bottom) which represent
the actual DS screens and constantly get displayed to the DS screens.
